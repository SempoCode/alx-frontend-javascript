0x02. ES6 Classes

Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding and implementing key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in JavaScript using ES6 classes. The tasks involve defining and manipulating classes, static methods, inheritance, getters and setters, as well as metaprogramming techniques like using symbols.

Throughout this project, the code will be written in JavaScript and tested using Jest. You are expected to gain a solid understanding of OOP principles and be able to confidently explain these concepts to others.

Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

Define a class and its constructor in ES6

Add methods and static methods to a class

Extend classes and understand inheritance in JavaScript

Utilize metaprogramming techniques such as symbols

Implement and use getters and setters for class attributes
